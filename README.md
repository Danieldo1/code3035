## About CODE3035 
 **CODE3035** is an innovative e-menu web application specifically crafted for a new and vibrant hookah lounge bar. The project prioritizes a seamless mobile user experience, ensuring that customers can effortlessly browse the menu and make selections from their smartphones and tablets. With the rise of mobile internet usage, **CODE3035** recognizes the importance of a mobile-first design and delivers a responsive and intuitive interface that adapts to various screen sizes and orientations. The heart of **CODE3035** lies in its robust admin panel. This secure backend interface is designed for the lounge bar's staff, enabling authorized personnel to manage the e-menu efficiently. The system supports comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, which means that the lounge staff can: 
 -  **Create** new menu items, complete with descriptions, pricing, and images, ensuring that customers have access to the latest offerings. 
 -  **Read** and review the current list of menu items for quality assurance and consistency checks.
  -  **Update** existing menu items to reflect changes in recipes, pricing, or availability, maintaining an accurate and up-to-date menu for patrons. 
  -   **Delete** menu items that are no longer available or have been phased out from the lounge's offerings. 
  
 This high level of control ensures that the e-menu can be dynamically updated in real-time, reflecting any changes immediately on the customer-facing side of the application. Whether it's a seasonal update, a special promotion, or a complete menu overhaul, **CODE3035**  empowers the lounge staff to keep the menu fresh and exciting. The application is built with scalability in mind, allowing for future enhancements such as customer feedback integration, order management, and analytics tracking. **CODE3035**  is not just an e-menu; it's a comprehensive tool designed to elevate the customer experience while streamlining the management process for the hookah lounge bar.
